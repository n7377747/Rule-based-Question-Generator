# Rule-based-Question-Generator
A system to take in a sentence, and generate questions out of valid clauses in the sentence.

<li>This work is mainly based on my understanding of the publication https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7732102/
<li>Install all the necessary libraries.
<li>Run speakup.py which should open a gui to interact with the system.
<li>Knowledge.py contains all the utility functions including question generation rules.
<li>Input can be either taken in the form of text or speech.
<li>remaining text and audio files are to store outputs or inputs used, in text or audio format.
